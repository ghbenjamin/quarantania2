## TODO


### FOV 
- Entities marked as non-light blocking shouldn't block light
- Entities should be able to block movement but not light   
- Some entities shouldn't be visible within fog of war (ones which might move!)


### Bugs

- Closing dialogs should be instant, rather than the suspicious wait we have now 

### UI

- Rework pathfinding path to be an arrow rather than squares 
- Make the 'walkable tiles' tile overlay much prettier w/ borders and ideally a nice shader

- Finish text log 
    -  Extension - including scrollback
- Add description view 
- Add spell/ability/feat interface 
- Add menus of all sorts 

## Items
- Ioun Stones
- Figurines of wonderous power
- Golem manual
- Scrolls, potions, wands, staves of arbitrary spells
